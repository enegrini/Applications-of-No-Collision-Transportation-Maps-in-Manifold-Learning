# Applications of No-Collision Transportation Maps in Manifold Learning
This repository provides the main code to implement the no-collison map algorithm from the paper "E. Negrini, L. Nurbekyan, Applications of No-Collision Transportation Maps in Manifold Learning."  <br /> 
 <br />  
The code is organized as follows: <br /> 
### Functions folder: <br /> 
contains the main functions to implement no-collision maps and the other methods we compare with. <br /> 
 <br /> 
### Jupyter Notebooks: <br /> 
**Translation_NoCollision.ipynb:** contains implementations of Translation Manifold reconstruction from Section 7.1 <br /> 
**Dilation_NoCollision.ipynb:** contains implementations of Dilation Manifold reconstruction from Section 7.2 <br /> 
**Rotation_NoCollision.ipynb:** contains implementations of Rotation Manifold reconstruction from Section 7.3 <br />
